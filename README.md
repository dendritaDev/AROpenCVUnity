## Object detection and Contour Creator
This C# code processes webcam images in Unity using OpenCV. It detects contours in the images, creates 2D polygons representing the contours, and allows these polygons to interact with Unity's physics system. Users can customize parameters like image flipping, binarization threshold, and more. The script integrates with Unity to display real-time processed images, enabling interaction with virtual physical objects.
